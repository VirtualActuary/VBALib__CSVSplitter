# CSV Splitter extension for VBALib
 This code forms an addition to the VBALib. It imports VBALib, extends VBALib, and exports the added functionality to be able to be used by VBALib. Currently, this way of work forms a circular dependency.

## Using Compile, Decompile and Replace VBA
 - `compile.cmd`: Compile the `src` directory and TemplateGenerator dependencies into `src.xlsb`
 - `decompile.cmd`: Decompile `src.xlsb` into `src`
